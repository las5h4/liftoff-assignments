## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Long List is a web app for creating grocery lists through meal planning. The project was conceived in April 2020 during a state-wide Stay-At-Home order due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.  In order to reduce the spread of Covid-19, many restaurants were closed and many people began cooking the majority of their meals at home. My girlfriend and I wanted to get enough groceries for two weeks at a time, so as to reduce the number of trips to the grocery store and protect ourselves from exposure, but we found the process of planning two weeks worth of meals and assembling a list of all of the needed ingredients to be time-consuming and stressful. The Long List is a web app meant to stream-line this process. 

When a user logs in to the app, they have the ability to create a Plan for as many days as they would like. As they add meals to each day in the Plan, they are prompted to add the required ingredients, and whether they have these ingredients on-hand, or need to buy more. Once they have completed their Plan, they can view and print a grocery list of all of the ingredients they need to buy at the grocery store, sorted by store department.
